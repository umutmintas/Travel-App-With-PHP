## Languages and tools used in this project 

- Html & CSS

- G Translate

# Web site Features
- Using G Translate, I made the whole page understandable in 12 different languages. It automatically translates the page according to the browser language of the user logging in to the website.  

- There is also a floating whatsapp button on the website, which is one of the important features for fast communication with the company.
